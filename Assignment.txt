Figure 1.1: Real-world data flow model - From application submission to random draw
Applicants
Lottery Engine
Housing Units
1. Problem Statement (Scenario)
"The Green City project has 500 apartments but received 1200 valid applications. Build a module for a fair draw."

Input: Import the list of applicants from the database (Table 'Applicant').

> Process: Randomly select 500 winners based on the provided seed.

> Output: Display the list of winners on the web interface and save it to Table 'Winner'.

2. Technical Requirements
MUST have JSP Model 2 (MVC) architecture. Do not use frameworks (Spring/Struts).

MUST have Draw logic uses java.security. SecureRandom ensures randomness.

MUST have Interface uses JSP + JSTL Core Tags (do not use Java scriptlets <% %>).

OPTIONAL: Add functionality to export results to PDF or Excel files for reporting.

3. Implementation Guide
1. Create Database Schema: 'Applicant' (id, name, status) & 'Winner' (ticket_id).

2. Build a Model (ApplicantDAO) to connect and retrieve data.

3. Write LotteryService: Implement the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm with SecureRandom.

cia
4. Create LotteryController (Servlet) to handle the POST request '/draw' and redirect to View.0
